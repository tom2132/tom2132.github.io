# Customize the menu
# In order to add/edit/delete entries from the main menu, you have to edit the menu.yml file inside _data folder. Through that file you can define the structure of the menu. Take a look at the default configuration to get an idea of how it works and read on for a more comprehensive explanation.
# The menu.yml file accepts the following fields:
#entries define a new unordered list that will contain menu entries
#each entry is marked by a - at the beginning of the line
#each entry has the following attributes:
# 	title, which defines the text to render for that menu entry
#	url, which can either be a URL or false. If it is false, the entry will be rendered as plain text; otherwise the entry will be rendered as a link pointing to the specified URL. Note that the URL can either be relative or absolute.
#	post_list, which can be true or false. If it is true, the entry will have all posts in the site as subentries. This is used to render your post list.
#entries, yes, you can have entries inside entries. In this way you can create nested sublists!
